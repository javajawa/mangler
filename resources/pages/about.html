About the Author

<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	This blog, tersely titled <em>Myself, Coding, Ranting, and Madness</em>
	is an ecelectic mixture of notes on programming, views on (mainly British)
	political happenings, and odd philosophical musings.

<h3>The Author: Benedict Harcourt</h3>
<p>
	Benedict Harcourt <abbr title="Master of Engineeing">MEng</abbr>
	<abbr title="Associate of the City and Guilds Institute">ACGI</abbr>
	is a recent graduate from <a href="http://imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College
	London</a>, where he studied <a
	href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/electricalengineering/infosys">Information
	Systems Engineering</a> (now Electronic and Information Engineering),
	graduating in 2012. Whilst there he enjoyed, spent time in, helped run, and
	(in terms of domicile law) nearly lived in the College's
	<a href="http://icsf.org.uk">Science Fiction Library</a>
</p>
<p>
	From there, he attempted to hide from the real world by hiding behind his
	computer at London-based tech company
	<a href="http://mindworklabs.com">Mindwork Labs</a>, where he configures
	his brain as a
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_(computing)">stack</a>, with
	the overhead of context switches worse than even that of
	<a href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/Inside-Pentium-4-Architecture/235/2">Pentium
	4</a> processor.
</p>
<p>
	In his spare time, he manages this blog, listens to a wide, wide range
	of <a href="http://last.fm/user/javajawa">music</a>, and works on a
	number programming projects, which can be found over on his
	<a href="https://github.com/javajawa">GitHub account</a>, with a
	variety of smaller pieces of code linked for his
	<a href="http://harcourtprogramming.co.uk/">main site</a>.
</p>
<p>
	His achievements include
	continuing to not use <a href="http://twitter.com/ben.harcourt">Twitter</a>,
	drinking three litres of Earl Grey tea a day, and
	having looked at every non-video post on
	<a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/">I Can Has Cheezburger</a>.
	These combined to the creation of
	<a href="http://tea-cats.co.uk">tea-cats.co.uk</a>, a website dedicated to
	cats with tea, or tea with cats, or any combination thereof.

<h3>The Blog: Purpose and Updates</h3>
<p>
	The blog was started because people asked Ben to start one. That kind of
	sums up why he does most things; people are cute, and he kinda likes them.
	I kept on mainly because it seemed a shame to stop, and I might one day
	write something of use.
</p>
<p>
	Another reason might be that I have always felt, and sometimes been told,
	that I lack good communication skills. There is some part of me that thinks
	that writing without the pressure of a direct recipient might one day help
	me to improve.
</p>
<p>
	Posts should come out at least once a week; the writing schedule varies
	drastically, with some days resulting in enough posts for 3 a week for
	the next month or so, and some months being entirely dry on content.
	A lot of this revolves around what is going on &mdash; posts about the
	author's life are generally avoided, and posts on politics and programming
	require politics and programming to happen.

	feed</a> in your favourite feed reader.
